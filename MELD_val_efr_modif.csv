788	Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.	anger
789	How is she?	sadness

791	How's the hair?	neutral
792	I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good.	sadness
793	I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.	neutral
794	Can we see her?	neutral
795	Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.	sadness
796	How're you doing?	sadness

798	Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.	joy
799	That would be no.	disgust

804	You've tasted it? You've tasted it.	surprise
805	Uh huh.	neutral
806	Oh, you've tasted it.	anger
807	I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.	anger
808	Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.	neutral
809	Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.	anger

830	Not one that can pee on the roof.	surprise
831	Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.	joy
832	And is this in case the house sneezes?	surprise
833	No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.	neutral
834	I don't want a ghost.	fear
835	Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.	neutral
836	Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.	surprise
837	Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.	neutral
