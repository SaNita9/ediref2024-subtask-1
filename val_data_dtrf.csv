I always have a date in my mind. When I eat ice cream, when ice cream starts appearing in my hand, I start using it. Then my mother looks at me and says how beautiful I am, Monisha. But my mother-in-law is staring at me like this in the hotel. I never asked for ice cream in my childhood. My man is my man. But my mother-in-law is my teacher. Despite my efforts to improve my carelessness, it has never been the same till now and I want it to be up to my level. What was the meaning of scurvy on our shores?"
